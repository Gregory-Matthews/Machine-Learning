Author: Gregory Matthews
Last Modified: 3/3/2018

General Libraries Used:
- numpy        (for math and matrix operations)
- matplotlib   (plotting output graphs)

-- Part 2: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python ANN.py
	2.) Statistical results of accuracy will be printed to the screen.
	3.) Plot of training accuracy will be saved as ANN_Training_Accuracy.png

Note: be sure that spambase.data is in the present working directory.

-- Part 3: Precision vs. Recall Graph
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python Precisicion_Recall.py
	2.) Plot of precision vs. Recall will be saved as Precison_Recall.png

Note: be sure that spambase.data is in the present working directory.

-- Part 4: Multi-Class Artificial Neural Networks
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python Multi_Class_ANN.py
	2.) Statistical results of accuracy will be printed to the screen.
	3.) Plot of training accuracy will be saved as Multi_Class_ANN_Training_Accuracy.png

Note: be sure that CTG.csv is in the present working directory.
