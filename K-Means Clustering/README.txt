Last Modified: 2/2/2018

General Libraries Used:
- numpy        (for math and matrix operations)
- random       (for random number generation)
- matplotlib   (for plotting)

-- Part 2:K-Means Clustering
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python clustering.py
	2.) Plot with initial seed will be saved as Initial Setup.png
	3.) Plot with initial clustering will be saved as Initial Clustering.png
	4.) Plot with final clustering will be saved as Final Clustering.png
	
-- Part 3: Purity
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python purity.py
	2.) Value of each cluster's seperate purity will be printed to screen.
	3.) Total purity among all clusters will be printed to screen.

-- Part 2: Flexible K-means Clustering
How to Run:
	1.) In terminal type :  python clustering_2.py
	2.) 3 Plots will be saved as Final Clustering-2X.png, where X = {1,2,3}
		a.) Plot 1 shows clustering on features 6,7, k=6, and plotting features 6,7
		b.) Plot 2 shows clustering on all features, k=5, and plotting features 6,7
		c.) Plot 3 shows clustering on all features, k=7. and plotting features 1,2
